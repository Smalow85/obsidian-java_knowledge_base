Spring 3.1 also introduces the new _@PropertySource_ annotation as a convenient mechanism for adding property sources to the environment.

We can use this annotation in conjunction with [[@Configuration]] annotation:

```java
@Configuration
@PropertySource("classpath:foo.properties")
public class PropertiesWithJavaConfig {
    //...
}
```

Another very useful way to register a new properties file is using a placeholder, which allows us to **dynamically select the right file at runtime**:

```java
@PropertySource({ 
  "classpath:persistence-${envTarget:mysql}.properties"
})
...
```
