ACID principles in [[SQL]] play a vital role in guaranteeing the reliability and integrity of data [[Transactions]]. ACID, which stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability, represents a comprehensive set of principles that guide the behavior of transactional systems.

1. **Atomicity:**

Atomicity ensures that a transaction is treated as an indivisible unit of work. It follows the **“all-or-nothing”** principle, where either *all the operations within a transaction are executed successfully, or none of them are*. Atomicity is maintained by the system using transaction logs or write-ahead logs (WALs). If any part of a transaction fails, the system can roll back all the changes made by the transaction, reverting the database to its original state. This guarantees that the database remains consistent and avoids partial updates.

2. **Consistency:**

Consistency in the ACID context refers to the state of data in a database after a transaction is executed. It ensures that the **database moves from one consistent state to another,** *adhering to predefined integrity constraints and business rules*. Before a transaction is committed, the database management system verifies that it satisfies all constraints. If the transaction violates any constraint, it is rolled back, preventing any inconsistent or invalid changes from being persisted. Consistency ensures the accuracy and validity of data throughout the transactional process.

3. **Isolation:**

Isolation deals with concurrent execution of multiple transactions in a multi-user environment. *It guarantees that each transaction is executed independently, without interference or dependency on other concurrently executing transactions.* Isolation prevents data integrity issues such as **dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads**. Different [[isolation levels]], such as Read Uncommitted, Read Committed, Repeatable Read, and Serializable, provide varying degrees of isolation. By managing the concurrent execution of transactions effectively, isolation maintains the integrity and consistency of data.

4. **Durability:**

Durability ensures that once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent and survive subsequent system failures. It involves persisting the changes made by a transaction to non-volatile storage, such as hard disks or solid-state drives. This way, even if a failure occurs, the system can recover and restore the committed data to its consistent state. Durability is achieved through techniques like [[write-ahead logging]] (WAL) or [[database replication]], where changes are safely stored on multiple devices or across multiple servers. It guarantees that the data remains intact and retrievable despite system outages or crashes.
