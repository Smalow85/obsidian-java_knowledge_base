APIs are mechanisms that enable two software components to communicate with each other using a set of definitions and protocols.

API architecture is usually explained in terms of client and server. The application sending the request is called the client, and the application sending the response is called the server. 

There are four different ways that APIs can work depending on when and why they were created.
### [[SOAP APIs]] 

These APIs use Simple Object Access Protocol. Client and server exchange messages using XML. This is a less flexible API that was more popular in the past.

### [[gRPC APIs]]

These APIs are called Remote Procedure Calls. The client completes a function (or procedure) on the server, and the server sends the output back to the client.

### [[REST APIs]]

These are the most popular and flexible APIs found on the web today. The client sends requests to the server as data. The server uses this client input to start internal functions and returns output data back to the client. Let’s look at REST APIs in more detail below.
## [[GraphQL APIs]]

GraphQL is a query language and runtime system for APIs (application programming interfaces). It is designed to provide a flexible and efficient way for clients to request data from servers, and it is often used as an alternative to REST (representational state transfer) APIs.
