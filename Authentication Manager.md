The _AuthenticationManager_ is the gateway for authentication requests in Spring Security. It acts as a conductor, orchestrating the authentication process by delegating the actual verification of user credentials to one or more _AuthenticationProvider_ instances.

### Key Responsibilities

**Processing** **Authentication Requests**: It accepts an Authentication object as input and attempts to authenticate the user based on the credentials provided.
  
**Delegating Authentication Tasks**: It delegates the authentication task to a list of AuthenticationProviders, each capable of handling different types of authentication.
  
**Returning Authentication Results**: On successful authentication, it returns a fully populated Authentication object, including details such as the principal and granted authorities.
