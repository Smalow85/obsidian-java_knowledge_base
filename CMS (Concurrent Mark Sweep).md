The CMS algorithm consists of several concurrent and stop-the-world phases:

1. Initial Mark: Pauses the application briefly to identify objects directly reachable from the root set.
2. Concurrent Mark: Concurrently traverses object graphs, marking objects that are still in use.
3. Concurrent Preclean: Continues marking objects concurrently while accounting for changes made during concurrent marking.
4. Final Remark: Pauses the application again to identify objects modified during concurrent marking and completes marking.
5. Concurrent Sweep: Concurrently reclaims memory by sweeping through and freeing unused objects.
6. Concurrent Reset: Concurrently resets internal data structures and prepares for the next [[Garbage collection]] cycle.
## How CMS Works

In simpler terms, CMS aims to perform garbage collection with minimal impact on application responsiveness:

1. The initial mark and final remark phases cause short pauses as they require analyzing root objects and marking reachable objects.
2. Concurrent marking occurs alongside application threads, identifying additional reachable objects.
3. The concurrent preclean phase handles any object modifications during concurrent marking.
4. Concurrent sweeping frees up memory by reclaiming unused objects while the application continues running.
5. Concurrent reset prepares the garbage collector for the next cycle, ensuring it is ready for future garbage collection.

## Pros of Using CMS:

- Reduced Pause Times: CMS aims to minimize pauses by performing garbage collection concurrently with the application, resulting in better application responsiveness.
- Improved Scalability: CMS is well-suited for large applications with high thread concurrency, as it strives to run concurrently with application threads.
- Effective for Mixed Workloads: CMS performs well in scenarios where the application generates a significant amount of short-lived objects.

## Cons and Considerations:

- Increased CPU Utilization: Concurrent execution can lead to higher CPU usage due to the additional threads involved in garbage collection.
- Fragmentation Concerns: CMS may suffer from memory fragmentation issues, leading to less efficient memory utilization.
- Limited Pause Reduction: While CMS reduces pauses compared to other algorithms, it may not eliminate pauses entirely, and long-running concurrent phases can still impact application performance.
- Deprecated in Java 9+: CMS is deprecated in Java 9 and later versions, with the intention to be removed in future releases. The introduction of the Garbage-First (G1) GC aims to provide a more efficient and scalable alternative.
