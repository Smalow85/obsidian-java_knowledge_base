#### 1. Streaming of Large Requests/Responses
Large data pieces are broken down into more manageable, smaller chunks which are then processed separately. Streaming minimizes memory usage, prevents potential timeouts, and reduces the latency between the client and server. For instance, when streaming a video, the user doesn’t have to wait for the full video to buffer, hence enhancing user experience by delivering content faster and more seamlessly.

#### 3. Batch Processing
Grouping similar requests together in a batch, rather than processing them individually, considerably reduces data transfer overhead. This is because it minimizes the number of round trips, or interactions between the client and server to obtain a response. For instance, in an e-commerce application, instead of retrieving each product detail individually, batching gathers all product details in a single request, which enhances response times and overall performance.
#### 4. Optimizing Critical Paths and Frequently Accessed Endpoints
This is the optimization of critical paths and frequently accessed endpoints. These paths and endpoints act as the vital junctions where most user requests are processed, converted, and delivered as output. Proper identification and optimization of these routes ensure seamless user experience and high-speed data delivery. For instance, when a user logs on to an e-commerce website, the critical paths may include user authentication, product search, and payment gateway. Prioritizing the performance of these backend endpoints helps in reducing latency and enhances page load speed, preserving optimum overall system health.

#### 5. Architectural Styles and Service Decomposition
Using Microservices, an application is broken into smaller, loosely coupled services, making it easy to maintain and scale, improving the overall backend performance. Service decomposition, on the other hand, allows for the distribution of responsibilities, meaning if one service fails, it won’t likely impact the entire system. Thus, understanding and efficiently managing architectural styles and service decomposition are critical for the optimized backend performance in web applications.
#### 6. Connection Timeouts and Efficient Retry Mechanisms
When an application attempts to establish a network connection, a reasonable connection timeout ensures the process doesn’t hang indefinitely while waiting for a response. This allows for optimal system resource utilization, reducing unnecessary load on the server, thereby enhancing backend performance. If the connection timeout is set too low, the application might terminate the process prematurely, reducing efficiency. Meanwhile, an effective retry mechanism is crucial to handle network failures. Without an efficient retry mechanism, network failures could trigger serious system errors or downtime. For example, if a network call fails due to temporary network issues, a well-implemented retry mechanism can attempt at re-establishing the connection, ensuring uninterrupted backend operations and enhanced application performance.
