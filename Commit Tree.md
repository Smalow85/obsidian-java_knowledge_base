In [[Git]], a commit tree is a fundamental concept that represents the history of changes in a repository. Let’s explore it:
#### What Is a Commit Tree?
A commit tree, also known as a commit history or commit graph, visualizes the lineage of commits in a Git repository.

Each commit represents a specific state of the project at a given point in time.
Commits are linked together in a directed acyclic graph (DAG), where each commit points to its parent commit(s).
The root commit is the initial commit with no parents, while subsequent commits form a branching structure as development progresses.
#### Key Aspects of the Commit Tree:
###### Parent-Child Relationships:
A commit can have one or more parent commits.
A single parent indicates a regular commit, while multiple parents signify a merge commit (combining different lines of history).
###### Branches and Tags:
Branches are pointers to specific commits within the commit tree.
Tags are labels assigned to specific commits (often used for versioning).
The HEAD (see [[committed history]]) points to the current commit (the latest state of the project).
When you create a new commit, the HEAD moves to the newly created commit.
###### Navigating the Tree:
You can move through the commit tree using commands like git log, which displays the commit history.
Visual tools (such as Git GUIs or online platforms) provide graphical representations of the commit tree.
Interacting with the Commit Tree:
Creating a Commit:
When you make changes to files, stage them using git add, and then commit using git commit.
The new commit becomes the latest node in the commit tree.
###### Branching and Merging:
Creating a new branch (e.g., git branch my-feature) creates a new pointer to an existing commit.
Merging branches combines their commit histories, creating a new merge commit.
###### Visualizing the Tree:
Tools like [[GitHub]]’s commit history or GitKraken display the commit tree graphically, making it easier to understand the project’s evolution34.

==!==Remember, the commit tree is the backbone of version control in Git. It captures the entire history of your project, allowing you to track changes, collaborate, and manage development effectively.
