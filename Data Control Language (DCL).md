**Data Control Language (DCL)** is a subset of **[[SQL]]** used to control access to data in a relational database. Let’s explore its key aspects:

1. **Purpose of DCL**:
    
    - DCL statements are primarily used to define **authorization rules** for database objects.
    - These rules determine who is authorized to perform specific operations on tables, views, stored procedures, and functions within the database.
2. **Common DCL Commands**:
    
    - `GRANT`: This command gives users specific access privileges to the database.
        - Example: Granting a user permission to read data from a particular table.
    - `REVOKE`: This command removes previously granted permissions.
        - Example: Revoking a user’s ability to modify data in a specific view.
    - `DENY`: Some database systems support the DENY command, which explicitly denies certain permissions.
        - Example: Denying a user the right to delete records from a specific table.
3. **Use Cases**:
    
    - DCL ensures that only authorized users can perform specific actions on the database.
    - It plays a critical role in maintaining data security and integrity.
