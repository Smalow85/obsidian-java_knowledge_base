#### 1. [[Connection Pooling]]

#### 3. Efficient Database Indexing

[[Indexes]] significantly cut short the time it takes for databases to retrieve and write data by providing swift navigational access to the rows in a table.
#### 4. Fine-Tuning ORM Queries

[[ORM]] help to convert data between incompatible types, enabling database manipulations using an object-oriented paradigm. However, they can also generate heavy, inefficient SQL queries without proper management
#### 5. Optimizing Data Retrieval with Lazy Loading, Eager Loading, and Batch Processing

**Lazy loading**, which entails loading data only when itâ€™s genuinely needed, can facilitate quicker initial page loading, thus improving user experience. On the contrary, **eager loading** minimizes the number of database queries by loading all necessary data upfront. **Batch processing** groups and executes similar tasks together, reducing the overhead associated with starting and ending tasks.
