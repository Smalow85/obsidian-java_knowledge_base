A domain name is a string of text that maps to an alphanumeric IP address, used to access a website from client software. In plain English, a domain name is the text that a user types into a browser window to reach a particular website. For instance, the domain name for Google is ‘google.com’.

The actual address of a website is a complex numerical [[IP Address]] (e.g. 192.0.2.2), but thanks to [[DNS]], users are able to enter human-friendly domain names and be routed to the websites they are looking for. This process is known as a DNS lookup.

## What is the difference between a domain name and a URL?

A uniform resource locator (URL), sometimes called a web address, contains the domain name of a site as well as other information, including the protocol and the path. For example, in the [[URL]] ‘https://cloudflare.com/learning/’, ‘cloudflare.com’ is the domain name, while [[HTTPS|https]] is the protocol and ‘/learning/’ is the path to a specific page on the website.

## What are the parts of a domain name?

Domain names are typically broken up into two or three parts, each separated by a dot. When read right-to-left, the identifiers in domain names go from most general to most specific. The section to the right of the last dot in a domain name is the top-level domain (TLD). These include the ‘generic’ TLDs such as ‘.com’, ‘.net’, and ‘.org’, as well as country-specific TLDs like ‘.uk’ and ‘.jp’.

To the left of the TLD is the second-level domain (2LD) and if there is anything to the left of the 2LD, it is called the third-level domain (3LD). Let’s look at a couple of examples:

For Google’s US domain name, ‘google.com’:

- ’.com’ is the TLD (most general)
- ’google’ is the 2LD (most specific)

But for Google UK’s domain name, ‘google.co.uk’:

- ’.com’ is the TLD (most general)
- ’.co’* is the 2LD
- ’google’ is the 3LD (most specific)

_*In this case, the 2LD indicates the type of organization that registered the domain (.co in the UK is for sites registered by companies)._
