The G1 GC is a parallel and concurrent [[Garbage collection]] strategy, that divides the heap into multiple regions. It operates based on the **concept of regions**, where each region is a **fixed-size block of memory**. The heap is dynamically divided into **Eden** regions, **survivor** regions, and **old regions**. The G1 GC collects garbage in a region-based manner, allowing it to prioritize the most heavily garbage-filled regions first.

## How G1 GC Works

1. Initial Marking: G1 GC starts by identifying the root objects directly reachable from application threads, such as static variables and reference objects.
2. Concurrent Marking: G1 GC concurrently marks live objects in the heap while the application threads continue to run. It uses a series of marking cycles to traverse the object graph, identifying live objects and updating the mark bits accordingly.
3. Remark: Once the concurrent marking phase is complete, G1 GC performs a stop-the-world remark phase to process any remaining objects that were modified during the concurrent marking.
4. Cleanup: G1 GC performs a cleanup phase to reclaim memory from the garbage-collected regions. It selects regions with the most garbage and compacts live objects into fewer regions to reduce fragmentation.
5. Evacuation: G1 GC uses the evacuation process to transfer live objects from one region to another, ensuring that regions are filled with mostly live objects and reducing the need for full garbage collections.
## Pros of Using G1 GC

- Improved Pause Times: G1 GC aims to provide more predictable and shorter pause times, especially for applications with large heaps, by minimizing the duration of stop-the-world garbage collection pauses.
- Adaptive Behavior: G1 GC adjusts its heap partitioning and collection strategies based on the application’s workload, allowing it to dynamically adapt to changing memory usage patterns.
- Better Utilization of Hardware Resources: G1 GC utilizes multiple threads for parallel garbage collection, which can lead to better utilization of available CPU resources, resulting in improved application throughput.
- Reduced Fragmentation: G1 GC’s compacting algorithm reduces memory fragmentation by reclaiming memory from regions with a high garbage-to-live object ratio.
## Cons of Using G1 GC

- Increased Overhead: Compared to other garbage collectors, G1 GC may introduce a slightly higher CPU overhead due to its more complex heap management and concurrent marking algorithms.
- Longer Application Warm-Up: G1 GC may exhibit longer warm-up times as it gathers statistics and adapts its behavior to optimize garbage collection performance.
