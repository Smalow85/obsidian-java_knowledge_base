HTTP methods are used to indicate the action an API client would like to perform on a given resource. Each [[HTTP]] method maps to a specific operation, such as creating, reading, updating, or deleting a resource, and an HTTP method must be included with every request to a REST API.

| 1 | **[[GET]]**<br><br>The GET method is used to retrieve information from the given server using a given URI. Requests using GET should only retrieve data and should have no other effect on the data. |
| ---- | ---- |
| 2 | **[[HEAD]]**<br><br>Same as GET, but transfers the status line and header section only. |
| 3 | **[[POST]]**<br><br>A POST request is used to send data to the server, for example, customer information, file upload, etc. using HTML forms. |
| 4 | **[[PUT]]**<br><br>Replaces all current representations of the target resource with the uploaded content. |
| 5 | **[[DELETE]]**<br><br>Removes all current representations of the target resource given by a URI. |
| 6 | **[[CONNECT]]**<br><br>Establishes a tunnel to the server identified by a given URI. |
| 7 | **[[OPTIONS]]**<br><br>Describes the communication options for the target resource. |
| 8 | **[[TRACE]]**<br><br>Performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource. |
