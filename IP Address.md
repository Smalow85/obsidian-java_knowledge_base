An IP address is a unique identifier assigned to each device on a network. It’s used to route data to the correct destination, ensuring that information is sent to the intended recipient. IP addresses are typically represented as a series of four numbers separated by periods, such as “192.168.1.1”.

The current internet standard, known as IPv4, only allows for about 4 billion IP addresses. This was considered a very big number in the 1970s, but today, the supply of IPv4 addresses is nearly exhausted.

So internet engineers have developed a new standard called [IPv6.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6) IPv6 allows for a mind-boggling number of unique addresses — the exact figure is [39 digits long](http://royal.pingdom.com/2009/05/26/the-number-of-possible-ipv6-addresses-read-out-loud/) — ensuring that the world will never again run out.

At first, the transition to IPv6 was slow. Technical work on the standard was completed in the 1990s, but the internet community faced a serious chicken-and-egg problem: as long as most people were using IPv4, there was little incentive for anyone to switch to IPv6.

But as IPv4 addresses became scarce, IPv6 adoption accelerated. The [fraction of users who connected to Google via IPv6](https://www.google.com/intl/en/ipv6/statistics.html) grew from 1 percent at the beginning of 2013 to 6 percent in mid-2015.
