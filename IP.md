The Internet Protocol (IP) is a protocol, or set of rules, for routing and addressing packets of data so that they can travel across networks and arrive at the correct destination. Data traversing the Internet is divided into smaller pieces, called [[Packet]]s. IP information is attached to each packet, and this information helps [[Router]]s to send packets to the right place. Every device or domain that connects to the Internet([[How Internet Works]]) is assigned an [[IP Address]], and as packets are directed to the IP address attached to them, data arrives where it is needed.

Once the packets arrive at their destination, they are handled differently depending on which transport protocol is used in combination with IP. The most common transport protocols are [[TCP]] and [[UDP]].
