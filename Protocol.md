In networking, a protocol is a set of rules for formatting and processing data. Network protocols are like a common language for computers. The computers within a network may use vastly different software and hardware; however, the use of protocols enables them to communicate with each other regardless.

On the Internet, there are different protocols for different types of processes. Protocols are often discussed in terms of which [[OSI]] model layer they belong to.
