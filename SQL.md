**SQL** (Structured Query Language) is a domain-specific language used to manage data, especially in **relational database management systems (RDBMS)**. Here are the key points about SQL:

1. **Purpose and Basics**:
    
    - SQL allows you to query, manipulate, and organize data within a relational database.
    - It excels at handling **structured data**, which involves relationships among entities and variables.
    - SQL is based on relational algebra and tuple relational calculus.
2. **Types of SQL Statements**:
    
    - **[[Data Query Language (DQL)]]**: Used for retrieving data (e.g., `SELECT` statements).
    - **[[Data Definition Language (DDL)]]**: For creating and modifying database schema.
    - **[[Data Control Language (DCL)]]**: Manages data access permissions.
    - **[[Data Manipulation Language (DML)]]**: Handles data insertion, updating, and deletion.
