The Serial GC algorithm operates in a stop-the-world manner, meaning it pauses the application’s execution during garbage collection. When the Serial GC is triggered, it performs the following steps:

1. **Initial Mark**: The algorithm identifies and marks all objects directly referenced by the application’s active threads. This marking process is performed while the application is paused briefly.
2. **Marking**: The algorithm traverses the object graph starting from the marked objects and identifies all reachable objects. It marks these reachable objects as live.
3. **Remark**: After the initial marking, the algorithm allows the application to resume briefly and continues marking any objects that became reachable during the pause.
4. **Sweep and Compact**: Once the marking is complete, the algorithm sweeps the memory regions, deallocating memory occupied by unreferenced objects. It then compacts the memory by moving live objects together, creating a contiguous free memory space.
5. **Free Memory**: After compaction, the algorithm updates the free memory space pointer to indicate the new location for object allocation.
## Pros of Using Serial GC:

1. Simplicity: The Serial GC is straightforward to implement and understand, making it an ideal choice for beginners or smaller applications.
2. Low Overhead: The algorithm has lower CPU and memory overhead compared to more complex GC algorithms, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments.
3. Predictable Pauses: As a stop-the-world collector, the Serial GC provides predictable pauses during garbage collection, allowing for better control over the application behavior.
4. Single-threaded Execution: The Serial GC performs garbage collection using a single thread, ensuring determinism and avoiding potential multi-threading issues.

## Cons of Using Serial GC:

1. Longer Pause Times: The stop-the-world nature of the Serial GC can result in longer pause times, causing interruptions in application responsiveness for larger heaps or memory-intensive applications.
2. Limited Scalability: The single-threaded nature of the Serial GC limits its scalability on modern multi-core processors, where parallelism can significantly improve GC performance.
3. Not Suitable for Large Applications: The Serial GC may not be the optimal choice for large-scale applications or systems with high memory requirements, as its performance may degrade due to increased garbage collection times.
