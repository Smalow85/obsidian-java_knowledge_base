Spring Boot is an extension of [[Spring]], which eliminates the boilerplate configurations required for setting up a Spring application. Featuring default codes and annotation based configuration, Spring Boot enables a faster and more efficient development ecosystem.

It provides a pre-configured platform for building Spring-powered applications with minimal XML and annotation-based configuration.
### What are the main features of Spring Boot?

Spring Boot includes the following features:

- Embedded server eliminates the need for complex application development
- Starter dependencies that facilitate building and configuring apps
- Automated Spring configuration
- Metrics, health check, and other reports
- Everything in Spring Boot is pre-configured. We simply need to use the proper configuration to use a specific functionality. If we want to create a REST API, we can use Spring Boot.
