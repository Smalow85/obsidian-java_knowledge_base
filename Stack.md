A **Stack** is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be **LIFO(Last In First Out)** or **FILO(First In Last Out)**. **LIFO** implies that the element that is inserted last, comes out first and **FILO** implies that the element that is inserted first, comes out last.
## Key Operations on Stack Data Structures
- **Push**: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
- **Pop**: Removes the top element from the stack.
- **Peek**: Returns the top element without removing it.
- **IsEmpty**: Checks if the stack is empty.
- **IsFull**: Checks if the stack is full (in case of fixed-size arrays).
## Applications of Stack Data Structures
- Recursion
- Expression Evaluation and Parsing
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Undo/Redo Operations
- Browser History
- Function Calls
