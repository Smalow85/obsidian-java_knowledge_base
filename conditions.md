SQL provides a `WHERE` clause that is basically used to filter the records. If the condition specified in the `WHERE` clause satisfies, then only it returns the specific value from the table. You should use the `WHERE` clause to filter the records and fetching only the necessary records.

The `WHERE` clause is not only used in SELECT statement, but it is also used in `UPDATE`, `DELETE` statement, etc., which we will learn in subsequent chapters.

```sql
SELECT * FROM Students WHERE Age>10;
```

`WHERE` clause can be combined with AND, OR, and NOT operators. Hereâ€™s an example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Students WHERE Age > 10 AND Gender = 'Female';
```
