Replication, in simple terms, is the process of copying data from one database server to another. It helps in maintaining a level of redundancy and improving the performance of databases. Replication ensures that your database remains highly available, fault-tolerant, and scalable.

## Why Use Replication?

Replication has several purposes:

- **High Availability**: By creating multiple copies of your data, if one server goes down, you can easily switch to another, leading to minimal downtime.
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute the load across multiple servers, allowing you to scale queries across multiple nodes while ensuring data consistency.
- **Backup**: Replication provides an effective backup method to recover data in case of hardware failure or data loss.
